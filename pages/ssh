ssh - connect to a remote system

connect

- ssh into the server
	ssh <user>@<hostname/ip_addr>

- your linux machine would be
	ssh new@10.0.0.207 (password protected)

- close a connection
	Ctrl + D

setting up a new connection

- generate an ssh key
	ssh-keygen -t rsa

- name the new ssh key (requires full file path)
	/path/to/ssh_file_name

- move .pub key to remote machine
	ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/<public_key_file> <user>@<hostname/ip_addr>

- if the connection is denied, check for openssh-server
	sudo apt install openssh-server

- check the ssh status
	sudo service ssh status

- if down, start it
	sudo service ssh start

exchanging files between two systems

- basic syntax
	scp <source> <destination>

- copy file from B to A while logged into B
	scp /path/to/file user@A:/path/to/destination

- copy a file from B to A while logged into A
	scp user@B:/path/to/file /path/to/destination
